    <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>

        <p>A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
        
        <div>Types of markup languages</div>
        <div>
        - Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).
        - Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).
        - Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).
        </div>
        
       <h2>1.2. HTML</h2> 
        
       <p> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        
       <p> HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
                <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
                <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
                <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
         </ol>
